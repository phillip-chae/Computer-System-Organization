/*
The bitwise AND (a&b) operator compares two numbers on
a bit level and returns a number where the bits of that
number are turned on if the corresponding bits of both
a and b are 1.

     a:   00101010   42
     b:   00001111   15
===================
   a&b:   00001010   10

As you see the 2's bit and the 8's bit are the only bits
that are on in both a and b, so a&b only contains those bits.

So remember for every given bit in a and b
  0 & 0 = 0
  0 & 1 = 0
  0 & 1 = 0
  1 & 1 = 1

    char a=15;
    char b=1;
    char c=5;
